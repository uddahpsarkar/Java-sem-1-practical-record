# Java Semester 1 Practical Record

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of 25 practical programs designed to demonstrate fundamental and advanced Java concepts. The programs cover object-oriented programming principles, data structures implementation, multithreading techniques, network programming, and file input/output operations.

## Programs

### [Program 1](program1/Prg1.java) - Employee Salary Calculator

**Concept:** Classes, Constructors, and Methods

A payroll management system that calculates net salary for multiple employees. This program demonstrates the implementation of constructors, methods, and basic object-oriented principles. The system handles allowance calculations, provident fund deductions, and tax computations to determine final take-home salary.

### [Program 2](program2/Prg2.java) - E-Commerce Website

**Concept:** Inheritance, Abstract Classes, and Dynamic Polymorphism

An object-oriented e-commerce system featuring multiple product categories. The program utilizes an abstract `Product` base class with concrete implementations for `Clothing`, `Electronics`, and `Sports` items. It includes a fully functional shopping cart system with inventory management capabilities and demonstrates method overriding and polymorphic behavior through dynamic method dispatch.

### [Program 3](program3/Prg3.java) - Arithmetic Calculator with Packages

**Concept:** Packages

A modular calculator application that demonstrates Java's package system. The program uses the `arithmeticpack.Calculator` package to perform fundamental arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This implementation showcases code organization, namespace management, and import statement usage.

### [Program 4](program4/Prg4.java) & [Server](program4/Server.java) - Client-Server Architecture

**Concept:** Multithreading and Networking

A robust TCP/IP-based client-server communication system demonstrating network programming and concurrent request handling. The server utilizes multithreading to manage multiple client connections simultaneously, while clients can send messages and receive server responses in real-time. The default communication port is configured to 5000.

### [Program 5](program5/Prg5.java) - Thread Synchronization

**Concept:** Mutual Exclusion and Thread Safety

A practical demonstration of thread synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions in concurrent environments. The program simulates bank account transactions with multiple threads accessing shared resources. It implements the `synchronized` keyword to ensure thread-safe operations and maintain data consistency across concurrent modifications.

### [Program 6](program6/Prg6.java) - Linked List Implementation

**Concept:** Data Structures

A custom implementation of a singly linked list data structure built from scratch. The program features insertion operations at both the beginning and end of the list, demonstrating node-based data structure manipulation and pointer-based memory management techniques.

### [Program 7](program7/Prg7.java) - HashSet and Iterator

**Concept:** Collections Framework - Set Interface

An exploration of the Java Collections Framework focusing on the `HashSet` collection for storing unique elements. The program demonstrates the use of the `Iterator` interface for safe collection traversal and implements proper element removal during iteration without causing concurrent modification exceptions.

### [Program 8](program8/Prg8.java) - Enumeration and Comparator

**Concept:** Collections and Sorting

A program demonstrating advanced collection operations using the `Vector` class for dynamic array management. It implements a custom `Comparator` interface to achieve descending order sorting and utilizes the `Enumeration` interface for sequential element traversal through the collection.

### [Program 9](program9/Prg9.java) - HashMap for Key-Value Storage

**Concept:** Map Interface

A student grade management system utilizing `HashMap` for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. The program stores student data as name-grade associations and demonstrates the use of `Map.Entry` for displaying stored pairs. Interactive input is handled through the `Scanner` class.

### [Program 10](program10/Prg10.java) - File Copy Operation

**Concept:** File I/O Operations

A file handling program that performs byte-level file copying operations. The program reads content from [textFileOne.txt](program10/textFileOne.txt) and writes it to [textFileTwo.txt](program10/textFileTwo.txt) using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`. It includes comprehensive exception handling for robust file operation management.

### [Program 11](program11/Prg11.java) - Text File Concatenation

**Concept:** File I/O Operations

A file handling program that concatenates two text files into a single combined output. The program reads content from [file1.txt](program11/file1.txt) and [file2.txt](program11/file2.txt), merges them sequentially using `BufferedReader` and `FileReader`, and displays the concatenated result. This demonstrates efficient file reading and string manipulation techniques.

### [Program 12](program12/Prg12.java) - Object Serialization

**Concept:** Serialization and Object Persistence

A program that demonstrates Java object serialization by converting an object into a byte stream. The program creates an `Employ` object with employee information and serializes it to [employ.txt](program12/employ.txt) using `ObjectOutputStream`. This showcases the implementation of the `Serializable` interface for persistent object storage and retrieval.

### [Program 13](program13/prg13.java) - Web Page Retrieval

**Concept:** URL and Network Programming

A program that demonstrates retrieving and parsing web page content using Java's `URL` class. The program connects to a website via URL, reads the HTML content, and extracts specific information such as the page title using string parsing techniques.

### [Program 14](program14/prg14.java) - Image Processing and Grayscale Conversion

**Concept:** Image Processing and Graphics

A program that demonstrates image processing by loading an image from a URL and converting it to grayscale. The program manipulates pixel data using `BufferedImage`, processes RGB color values, and saves the resulting grayscale image to disk using `ImageIO`.

### [Program 15](program15/prg15.java) - AWT Registration Form with Event Handling

**Concept:** GUI Programming and Event Handling

A comprehensive GUI application built using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) that demonstrates creating a registration form with various controls including text fields, choice menus, checkboxes, and buttons. The program implements event handling through the `ActionListener` interface to respond to user interactions.
